                <h2>Playlist Time!</h2>
                <p>Here are some of my favorite K-Pop songs that I put into a playlist...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A2O MAY - "Boss"</strong>: One of their original songs. While this is <i>technically</i> C-Pop, my Kpop pipeline was destined for this hit.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>BLACKPINK - "Jump"</strong>: A super up-beat, techno song with a GORGEOUS choreo and fun MV.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITZY - "Wannabe"</strong>: A girl-crush themed song with a super-cool and easy-to-learn choreo. I should know, I've LIVED that 
                        Just Dance track.</li>
                    <li><strong>TWICE - "Strategy"</strong>: A cute song that puts you in a great mood with its catchy tune and playful vibe.</li>
                    <li><strong>BABYMONSTER - "We Go Up"</strong>: Okay, this one straight-up <i>HAS</i> to take the cake as my 
                        favorite Kpop song OAT. With its chaotic MV and feminist boss energy, it quickly became one of my favorite Kpop/Rap 
                        songs. And it's NOT just because my bias is the rapper queen ASA...</li>
                    <li><strong>BABYMONSTER - "Hot Sauce"</strong>: Let's be real. That 'little bit of everything, whole lotta energy' line 
                    must have had <i>SOMETHING</i> in it with how addictive it is. Because of course you won't get ahead of me, I'm literally 
                100 miles per hour with a whole lotta energy!</li>
                        <li><strong>BABYMONSTER - "Drip"</strong>: You may be starting to see a pattern here&mdash; and you'd be right. 
                        But Babymonster is just TOO massively majestic, almost like the low taper fade in the massive '26. 'Drip' is what 
                    really set them going with their music career, with a catchy instrumental and crazy, unapologetic visuals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="recommendation">You can listen to this track at <a>this Spotify playlist.</a></p>
