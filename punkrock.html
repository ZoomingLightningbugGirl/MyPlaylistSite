                <h2>Playlist Time!</h2>
                <p>Here are some of my favorite Punk-Rock songs that I put into a playlist...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Green Day - "American Idiot"</strong>:  Let's be real here. This is 100% their most iconic song. As an Idiot 
                        Nation's national anthem, it serves as an identifying proof of the denial of typical American oblivion under politics. 
                        It carries a natural empowerment that makes you want to get up, protest, and be what makes you unique from others.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Green Day - "Basket Case"</strong>: I love this one for its role in my childhood. I listened to it a lot growing 
                    up, and it always elevates my mood!</li>
                    <li><strong>Awolnation - "Passion"</strong>: A strong, unapologetic anthem of pursuing what makes you, <i>you</i>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Awolnation - "Sail"</strong>: An admission to one's shortcomings, it just has some sort of ingredient that 
                    makes you want to fight for your right to be seen in all your fallouts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Awolnation - "The Best"</strong>: With a fun MV and catchy chorus, it DEFINITELY makes me want to "walk a 
                    little bit taller". This was the song I found at eight years old that brought me into the AWOL fandom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moonwalker HQ - "New God"</strong>: A calling-out to the harsh political and scientific control of the 
                    Church, this authentic indie punk-rock artist inspires people to rethink what it means to be spiritually connected to 
                one another in a poetry-like lyrical fashion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Green Day - "Jesus of Suburbia"</strong>: If you can't tell, Green Day is a pretty popular tenant 
                        living rent-free in my Spotify. Though Jesus of Suburbia is sometimes a <i>tad</i> too long for my "dingaling TikTok 
                    brain" (quote from my bio teacher), it still has a delightful melody that puts me in an upbeat mood. I'd totally recommend 
                it for people who like longer songs with a similar vibe through the whole thing so you don't have to keep replaying it. Because it 
            is TOTALLY replay-worthy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="recommendation">You can listen to this track at <a>this Spotify playlist.</a></p>
